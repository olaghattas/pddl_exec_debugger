This package serves as a tool for testing and debugging PDDL files without the need for a simulator or any action servers. By utilizing a graphical user interface (GUI) and user input, predicates and results to actions are set, which facilitates a faster and easier debugging process. This approach allows for quick modifications and testing of different scenarios.

 You need to clone the PDDL_Executor repo: git clone https://github.com/olaghattas/PDDL-Executor
or run 
git clone --recurse-submodules pddl_exec_debugger 
that would install PDDL_Executor
